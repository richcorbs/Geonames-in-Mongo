# This project is an experiment to see what I could do with geonames data and MongoDB's geospatial indexing.
#
# This repo includes links to the raw data and my Ruby scripts for importing and querying the data.
#
# The data is available at: http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/
#
# I used the allCountries.zip and alternateNames.zip files.
